# Banking App

## Description

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/ChristianoDc7/banking-app.git`
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory using the command line: `cd backend`
3. Install the dependencies using Yarn: `yarn install`
4. Run the app using `yarn run dev` and that's all

Note that the frontend is currently under development, and will be released soon.
